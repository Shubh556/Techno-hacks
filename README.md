## Task 1 and Task 2

In Task 1 and Task 2, my responsibility was to clean up the data provided by the company. This involved removing any duplicate entries or empty values. Once those were addressed, I needed to find any outliers in the dataset. To accomplish this, I used the  Interquartile Range (IQR)  Method, which aids in the detection and removal of outliers from a dataset.

## Task 3

In Task 3, my responsibility was to clean up the data provided by the company. This included removing any duplicate entries or empty values. Once those were resolved, I needed to look for any outliers in the dataset. I used the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method to remove outliers from a dataset and visualized the data with histplots.
